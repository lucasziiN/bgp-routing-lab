Displayed  6 routes and 13 total paths


Side note: I think I only have such few paths because AS90 isn't sharing any of his routes with me. They could be sharing paths to AS 92 and AS 93, which are their customers but aren't so :( . My provider, AS 86 also isn't contributing with any routes as themselves don't have many. And there is only 1 or 2 peers in my IXP that have done some of their configuration but I dont think they started sharing routes at all.
